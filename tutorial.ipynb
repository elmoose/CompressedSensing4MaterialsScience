    "The feature space is generated by creating a list of analytical expressions (the derived features), obtained by combining <i> primary features </i> and arithmetic operations. In this example, the primary features are properties of isolated atoms, such as electorn affinity or the radial extension of valence orbitals. We put all $m$ derived features into a descriptor matrix $\\mathbf{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{82 \\times m}$ where each column stands for a derived feature and each row for a compound. An $\\ell_0$-regularization \n",
    "\n",

    "determines those few feature columns which approximate a property vector $\\mathbf{P} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{82}$ (i.e RS vs. ZB energy differences) best. The subscript 0 stands for the $\\ell_0$-quasinorm, that counts the number of non-zero elements of $\\mathbf{c}$ and $\\lambda > 0$ is called the regularization parameter. Performing the $\\ell_0$-regularization becomes fast computational infeasable and often approximations (i.e. LASSO, orthogonal matching pursuit) are needed since in practice the $\\ell_0$-regularization needs to be solved combinatorial: All singletons, pairs, triplets, ... $n$-tuples (up to the selected maximum dimension of the descriptor) are listed and for each set a least-square regression is performed. The $n$-tuple that gives the lowest mean square error for the least-square regression fit is selected as the resulting $n$-dimensional descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The LASSO method\n",
    "A convex optimization problem can be introduced by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO):\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{argmin}_{\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}} \\{\\|\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{c}\\|^2_2 +\\lambda \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|_1\\}$.\n",

    "Under certain conditions on the matrix $\\mathbf{D}$, it can find the exact solution of, or a good approximation to, the $\\ell_0$-regularization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The SISSO method\n",
    "SISSO works iteratively. In the first iteration, a number $k$ of features is collected that have the largest correlation (scalar product) with $\\mathbf{P}$. The feature with the largest correlation is simply the 1D descriptor. Next, a residual is constructed as the error made in the first iteration. A new set of $k$ features is now selected as those having the largest correlation with the residual. The 2D descriptor is the pair of features that yield the smallest fitting error upon least-square regression, among all possible pairs contained in the union of the sets selected in this and the first iteration. In each next iteration a new residual is constructed as the error made in the previous iteration, then a new set of $k$ features is extracted as those that have largest correlation with each new residual. The $n$D descriptor is the $n$-tuple of features that yield the smallest fitting error upon least square regression, among all possible $n$-tuples contained in the union of the sets obtained in each new iteration and all the previous iterations. If $k=1$ the method collapses to the so-called orthogonal matching pursuit.\n",

    "## Kernel ridge regession\n",
    "It is instructive to compare the performance of the just identified model with a model trained with the popular kernel ridge regression (KRR) approach, by using the same list of atomic features as input. \n",
    "KRR solves a $\\ell_2$ regularized linear regression problem, with (typically) a nonlinear kernel.\n",
    "This can be descirbed in the following manner. The $\\ell_2$ regularized linear regression problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{argmin}_{\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m}} \\{\\|\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{c}\\|^2_2 +\\lambda \\|\\mathbf{c}\\|_2\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its solution is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{c} = \\left( \\mathbf{D}^\\top \\mathbf{D} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{D}^\\top \\mathbf{P}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Acoording to Hilbert space representaiton theorem, we can write the solution vector $\\mathbf{c}$ as a linear expansion over the data points represented acoording to the chosen descriptor. In other words, $\\mathbf{c}$ can be represented as a linear expansion over the rows $\\mathbf{d}_j$ of the matrix $\\mathbf{D}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{c} = \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\mathbf{d}_j $\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewriting leads to the equivalent problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\text{argmin}_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}} \\{\\|\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{K}\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}\\|^2_2 +\\lambda \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}^\\top \\mathbf{K} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\} \\quad (1)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the kernel $\\mathbf{K}$ is: $K_{ij} = < \\mathbf{d}_i, \\mathbf{d}_j > $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewritten problem has solution $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\left( \\mathbf{K} + \\lambda \\mathbf{I} \\right)^{-1} \\mathbf{P} \\quad (2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This rewriting did not add anything to the regularized linear regression approoach. If, however, we now expand the vector $\\mathbf{c}$ as an expansion of nonlinear functions $\\Phi()$ of the vectors $\\mathbf{d}_j: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{c} = \\sum_j \\alpha_j \\Phi(\\mathbf{d}_j) $\n",
    "\n",
    "and the kernel as: $K_{ij} = < \\Phi(\\mathbf{d}_i), \\Phi(\\mathbf{d}_j)> $, one can prove that the same problem (1) with the same solution (2) holds. Normally, people do not specify the function $\\Phi()$, but rahter the kernel.\n",
    "Actually, $\\Phi()$ does not need to be known at all. We refer to the specialized literature on KRR for more details on this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we make use of the Gaussian kernel, i.e., the most popular one:\n",
    "\n",
    "$K(x, y) = \\exp(-\\gamma ||x-y||^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\gamma$ are called <i> hyperparameters </i> and are set via CV. \n",
    "Specifically, at each LOOCV step, the hyperparameters ($\\ell_2$-regularization parameter $\\lambda$ and inverse gaussian width $\\gamma$) are optimized via a grid search and a so-called 5-fold cross-validation on the training set. This means splitting the training set in 5 subsets, 1 subset is used for evaluating the performance (RMSE) and the other 4 for training. The procedure is repeated 5 times by changing the test subset and the overall perfrmance is the RMSE over all repetitions. \n",
